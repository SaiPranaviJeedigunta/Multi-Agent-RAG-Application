# ResearchSphere: End-to-End Document Research

## Objective
Build an end-to-end research tool using an Airflow pipeline for document processing, vector storage with Pinecone, and a multi-agent research system powered by LangGraph. The system enables efficient document-based research, query answering, and exportable findings.

---

## Problem Statement
Research often involves parsing through extensive documents, retrieving relevant data, and synthesizing actionable insights. Current methods are time-consuming and inefficient, relying heavily on manual work. This project addresses the need for automation and intelligence in research workflows by building a pipeline to process documents, store vectors for similarity search, and create a multi-agent system for enhanced research capabilities.

---

## Project Summary
This project automates the ingestion, processing, and retrieval of publication data using advanced technologies. Key features include:
1. **Airflow Pipeline**: Automates document parsing using Docling and stores vectors in Pinecone for similarity search.
2. **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes LangGraph to orchestrate research tasks, including document selection, Arxiv-based research, web search, and answering queries with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
3. **User Interaction**: Provides an interface using Streamlit for users to ask questions, save research sessions, and export results in professional formats.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Document Parsing, Vector Storage, and Pipeline Setup
1. **Airflow Pipeline**:
   - Uses Docling to parse documents, extracting structured text from PDFs.
   - Stores document vectors in Pinecone for efficient similarity search.
   - Automates the end-to-end pipeline using Apache Airflow.
2. **Technologies**:
   - Docling for document parsing.
   - Pinecone for vector-based storage and retrieval.
   - Airflow for automation and orchestration.

---

### Part 2: Research Agent with Pinecone and LangGraph
1. **Research Agents**:
   - **Document Selector**: Enables selection of documents processed in Part 1.
   - **Arxiv Agent**: Searches for related research papers on Arxiv.
   - **Web Search Agent**: Performs broader online research for context.
   - **RAG Agent**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on the document's content.
   - **Answer Generator**: Provides concise answers or summaries using OpenAI or similar APIs.

2. **Workflow**:
   - Agents are orchestrated by LangGraph, interacting with Pinecone for vector retrieval and external APIs for additional insights.
   - Pinecone facilitates fast similarity search, enhancing query efficiency.

---

### Part 3: Research Interface and Q/A Interaction
1. **User Interface**:
   - Built using Streamlit to allow users to:
     - Ask 5-6 questions per document.
     - View structured answers or summaries.
     - Save research session results.
2. **Export Results**:
   - **PDF Export**: Generates professional reports summarizing findings.
   - **Codelabs Export**: Structures findings for instructional use.

---

## Features
1. **Document Processing**:
   - Automates document ingestion, parsing, and vector storage.
2. **Multi-Agent System**:
   - Offers advanced research capabilities through document selection, Arxiv search, web search, and RAG-based Q/A.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple yet powerful interface for research interaction and result export.
